iPhone Programming Exercise
================

- Developer proficiency test
- Requires XCode 5 & iOS7
- Whilst this runs on iOS6, to keep things simple it was only designed (visually) for iOS7


*Note* To fix the `Could not find a storyboard named 'Main' in bundle NSBundle` error, please pull the latest version of 
CreateDigital/CreateDigital-info.plist

Alternatively, just manually remove lines 27 & 28 from CreateDigital-info.plist

`<key>UIMainStoryboardFile</key>`

`<string>Main</string>`
